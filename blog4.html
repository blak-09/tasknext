             <h1>Ethical Considerations in Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>Balancing Innovation with Responsibility</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century. From healthcare and finance to education and entertainment, AI is changing the way we live and work. However, along with its immense potential come serious ethical challenges that need to be addressed responsibly.</p>

    <h2>1. Bias and Fairness</h2>
    <p>AI systems learn from data — and if that data contains biases, the AI can reinforce or even amplify them. For example, facial recognition tools have shown lower accuracy for certain ethnic groups. Ensuring fairness requires developers to audit datasets and build inclusive algorithms that serve all communities equally.</p>

    <h2>2. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
    <p>AI often relies on massive amounts of personal data to function effectively. Ethical AI demands transparency in how data is collected, stored, and used. With regulations like GDPR, there is increasing pressure to ensure user privacy and give individuals control over their data.</p>

    <h2>3. Transparency and Explainability</h2>
    <p>Many AI models, especially deep learning systems, are often referred to as "black boxes" because their decision-making processes are not easily understandable. This lack of transparency can be dangerous, especially in critical applications like healthcare or criminal justice. Developers must strive for explainable AI to build trust.</p>

    <h2>4. Accountability</h2>
    <p>Who is responsible when an AI system makes a harmful decision — the developer, the company, or the algorithm itself? Ethical AI requires clear accountability frameworks to determine responsibility and liability when things go wrong.</p>

    <h2>5. Job Displacement and Economic Impact</h2>
    <p>As AI continues to automate tasks, there is a growing concern about its impact on employment. While new jobs may be created, many traditional roles are at risk. Ethical considerations must include retraining programs and policies to help workers transition in an AI-driven economy.</p>

    <h2>6. Autonomous Weapons and Military Use</h2>
    <p>One of the most controversial uses of AI is in autonomous weapons. The idea of machines making life-or-death decisions raises deep ethical and moral concerns. Many experts advocate for strict international regulation to prevent the misuse of AI in warfare.</p>

    <h2>Key Principles of Ethical AI</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Algorithms should be understandable and explainable.</li>
      <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Human oversight must be maintained.</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Protect user data and confidentiality.</li>
      <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Avoid and mitigate algorithmic bias.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Ensure systems do not cause harm.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>AI holds incredible promise, but it also carries ethical responsibilities. As we continue to develop and deploy intelligent systems, we must do so thoughtfully, ensuring that human values, rights, and dignity remain at the core of innovation. Ethical AI is not just a goal — it's a necessity for a just and sustainable future.</p>
